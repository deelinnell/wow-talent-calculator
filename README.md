WOW-TALENT-CALCULATOR

Since WoW Classic came out I've been playing around with the talent calculators online and decided I'd try making one. The talent calculator has a lot of small parts that get reused so I thought it would be good practice to make in React. I'm still not sure if I understand state all the way, but I've been using a lot of it with this project. I basically just make everything state and it's been a bit of a pain to work with, but it's been good pratice. I've really been learning the difference between how React works vs regular Javascript.

I'm almost done with the Paladin talent trees, there's just a few things I need to figure out. I thought this project would be easier than it has ended up being, all the logic associated with whether or not you can add / remove a talent point as been more complex than it seemed on the surface. I don't know if I'll be making any of the other classes since at that point it would mostly just be busy work since I would have solved all the problems associated with how the calculator works.
