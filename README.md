WOW-TALENT-CALCULATOR

Since WoW Classic came out I've been playing around with the talent calculators online and decided I'd try making one of my own. The talent calculator has a lot of small parts that get reused so I thought it would be good practice to make it in React. I'm still not sure if I quite understand state all the way, but I've been using a lot of it in this project. I been making just about everything state for practice. It's been a bit of a pain to work with, but I think I'm finally getting the hang of it. And I've been learning the differences between how React works vs regular Javascript.

I'm almost done with the paladin talent tree, there's just a few small things I need to figure out. I thought this project would be easier than it has turned out being, all the logic associated with whether or not you can add / remove a talent point as been more complex than it seemed it would be on the surface. I don't know if I'll end up making any of the other classes talent trees since at this point it would be mostly busy work since I have most of the logic sorted out already and it wouldn't take much brain power / I wouldn't learn much doing it.
